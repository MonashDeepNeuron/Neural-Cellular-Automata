				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					Neural Cellular Automata (NCA) are a category of cellular automata that involve using a neural network as the cell‚Äôs update rule.
					The neural network can be trained to determine how to update the cell‚Äôs value in coordination with other cells, operating on the
					same rule to produce a target behavior.
				</p>

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					From a deep learning perspective, NCA can be characterized as a Recurrent Convolutional Neural Network. Learn more about this{' '}

					(A. Mordvintsev et al., 2020), where they trained NCA to ‚Äògrow‚Äô target images from a single seed cell.
				</p>

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					The Growing-NCA model emphasises that the perception of only neighbouring cells bears parallels with how natural cells communicate
					within living organisms. Interestingly, this results in Growing Neural Cellular Automata (and other NCA) also showing natural
					regenerative properties when the image is disturbed during generation.
				</p>

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					Designed to cut the model back to as simple and small a system as possible, Growing NCA is designed as a demonstration of how
					exceedingly simple systems can robustly self-organise into a very complex system without a large amount of information and very
					simple instructions.
				</p>

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					Understanding this model is a good foundation for Neural Cellular Automata, as a large portion of NCA use a very similar base
					structure, with varying objective functions. They incorporate relevant optimisations and recombination.

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					Life like CA operate very similarly to the Game of Life in that all cells are either alive or dead. However, Life Like gives you
					the freedom to choose how many cells must be alive in the neighbourhood to either survive or be born. This is specified by a{' '}
					<i>rule string</i>.
				</p>

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					The rule string format we have used is <i>survival/birth notation.</i> In this notation, the original Game of Life would be
					expressed as <b>23/3</b> (we don‚Äôt worry about spacing between numbers because they can only be the numbers 0-8), where 2 or 3
					cells in the neighbourhood are required for survival of a living cell, and 3 cells in the neighbourhood are required for a dead

				<p className='leading-7 text-lg mt-4'>
					Continuous CA also builds on Life Like CA. The main difference is that instead of using the binary dead or alive as states, we use
					a continuous range of values. The new cell state value is calculated in by multiplying each neighbour by a weight, adding this
					together and applying a basic mathematical function to it. Continuous CA can display behaviours similar to basic organisms and
					population level behaviours of bacteria etc. that have simple behavioural patterns.
